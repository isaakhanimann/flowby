## the skill market place app

The objective is to connect people closeby so they can meet people with skills or get money for offering their skills.


## What it looks like

You can create a profile, add your skills for the price you want to offer them for. Add the skills you wish to receive and what you are willing to pay for those, so people who offer them can find you.
